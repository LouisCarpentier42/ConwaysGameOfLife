# Conway's Game Of Life

A small application for simulating [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), 
based on `PyGame` for visualisation, and `numpy` for data representation. Basic 
function is provided to create an initial state together with some nifty 
features to automatically simulate the _game of life_ and to nicely view the 
past generations.
